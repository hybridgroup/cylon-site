    ## Meet The Code

    Cylon.js is a JavaScript framework for robotics, physical computing, and the Internet of Things. It makes it incredibly easy to command robots and devices.

    All you need to get started is the `cylon` NPM module:

        $ npm install cylon

%section#hello-world
  :markdown
    ## The "Hello, World" Of Things

    This example will connect to an [Arduino](/documentation/platforms/arduino), and toggle an [LED](/documentation/drivers/led) every one second.

        :::javascript
        var Cylon = require("cylon");

        // Initialize the robot
        Cylon.robot({
          // Change the port to the correct port for your Arduino.
          connections: {
            arduino: { adaptor: 'firmata', port: '/dev/ttyACM0' }
          },

          devices: {
            led: { driver: 'led', pin: 13 }
          },

          work: function(my) {
            every((1).second(), function() {
              my.led.toggle();
            });
          }
        }).start();

    To run it:

        $ npm install cylon-firmata
        $ node script.js

    We've got [lots more examples here](/documentation/examples) to help you get started on your next IoT project.

%section#platforms
  %h2#platforms Platform Support

  %div
    %p Cylon.js has a extensible system for connecting to hardware devices. The following robotics and physical computing systems, and software platforms, are currently supported:

    %ul.platform-list
      - data.platforms.each do |name, info|
        %li.platform
          %a{:href => "/documentation/platforms/#{info.slug}"}
            %p.title= name
            %img{src: "/images/devices/#{info.slug}.jpg", style: "width: 90%"}
    .clear

  %p Support for many devices that use General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) have a shared set of drivers provided using the `cylon-gpio` module:

  %ul.platform-list
    - data.drivers.GPIO.each do |name, url|
      %li.platform
        %a{:href => "/documentation/drivers/#{url}"}
          %p.title= name
          %img{src: "/images/devices/#{url}.jpg", style: "width: 90%"}
    .clear

  %p Support for devices that use Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C) have a shared set of drivers provded using the `cylon-i2c` module:

  %ul.platform-list
    - data.drivers.I2C.each do |name, url|
      %li.platform
        %a{:href => "/documentation/drivers/#{url}"}
          %p.title= name
          %img{src: "/images/devices/#{url}.jpg", style: "width: 90%"}
    .clear

%section#browser-mobile
  :markdown
    ## Browser & Mobile Support

    Cylon.js can be run directly in-browser, using the `browserify` NPM module. You can also run it from within a Chrome connected app, or a PhoneGap mobile app.

    For more info on browser support, and for help with different configurations, you can find more info [in our docs](/documentation/guides/browser-support).

%section#api
  :markdown
    ## API

    Cylon has a built-in API that you can interact with your robots.

    All you need to start up the API server is to place the following command in your `.js` file after you require Cylon.

        :::javascript
        var Cylon = require("cylon");
        Cylon.api();

    Then visit `https://localhost:3000/` and you are ready to control your robots from a web browser!

    You can check out more information on the Cylon API in the docs [here](/documentation/core/api).

    ## CLI

    <script src="https://asciinema.org/a/10306.js" id="asciicast-10306" data-autoplay="1" data-loop="true"></script>

    Cylon uses the [Gort][] toolkit, so you can access important features from the command line.
    You can scan, connect to devices, update firmware, and more!
    We call it "RobotOps", a.k.a. "DevOps for Robotics".

    Cylon also has it's own CLI tool to generate new modules, robots, and drivers.

    You can check out the Cylon CLI docs [here][cli-docs].
