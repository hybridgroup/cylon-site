      The Intel Edison is a wifi and BluetoothÂ® enabled devolopment platform for the 
      Internet of Things. It packs a robust set of features into its small size and supports 
      a broad spectrum of I/O and software support.

    ## How To Install

    ### Setting up your Intel Edison

    Everything you need to get started with the Edison is in the Intel Getting Started Guide 
    located [here](https://communities.intel.com/docs/DOC-23147). Don't forget to 
    configure your Edison's wifi connection and [flash](https://communities.intel.com/docs/DOC-23192) 
    your Edison with the latest firmware image!

    After you have flashed your Edison and followed the steps in the Intel Getting Started Guide,
    you must now install the latest version of the 
    [Intel MRAA library](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/mraa). In order to update MRAA
    you simply log into your Edison, through ssh or the uart serial connection, and follow 
    the steps [here](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/mraa#installing-on-your-board).

    ### Installing Cylon

    Once you have flashed your Edison with the latest firmware as well as updated MRAA, 
    you will now install `cylon-intel-iot` on the Edison. To do this you must be
    logged into the board, through ssh or the uart serial connection, and execute the
    following command `npm install cylon-intel-iot`.

    Once `cylon-intel-iot` has been installed on your Edison, you're ready to start
    programming!
