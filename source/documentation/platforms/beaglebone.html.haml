    ## How To Install

    Installing Cylon.js for the BeagleBone Black is pretty easy, but must be done on the Beaglebone Black itself, or on another Linux computer.
    Due to I2C device support, the module cannot be installed on OS X or Windows.

        $ npm install cylon-beaglebone

    ## How To Use

        :::javascript
        var Cylon = require('cylon');

        // Initialize the robot
        Cylon.robot({
          connection: { name: 'beaglebone', adaptor: 'beaglebone' },
          devices: [
            { name: 'led', driver: 'led', pin: 'P9_12' },
            { name: 'button', driver: 'button', pin: 'P9_14' }
          ],

          work: function(my) {
            my.button.on('push', function() {
              my.led.toggle()
            });
          }
        }).start();


%section.how-to#HowToConnect
  :markdown
    ## How To Connect

    You will likely want to connect your development machine to your BeagleBone Black while working on your code.
    You can do this easily, just by connecting to the BeagleBone Black over USB.
    Then, you can connect to the BBB using Network-Over-USB, and upload driver or configuration changes.

    ### OS X

    For OS X, some drivers need to be installed to allow Network-Over-USB access to the BeagleBone black.
    You can find the instructions on the BeagleBone site's [getting started page](http://beagleboard.org/getting-started#step2).

    Once you've installed the drivers and connected to the BeagleBone over USB, you can just SSH into it.
    The BBB should have an IP address of `192.168.7.2`.

    ### Linux

    For Linux machines, you will need to create a udev rule.
    You can find the instructions on the BeagleBone site's [getting started page](http://beagleboard.org/getting-started#step2).

    To connect to the BeagleBone Black from your Linux machine, save this script as `bbb.sh` (or whatever name you'd prefer).
    Executing the script will then SSH into the BBB.

        :::bash
        #!/bin/bash
        sudo -- sh -c 'echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward'
        sudo iptables -A POSTROUTING -t nat -j MASQUERADE
        ssh root@192.168.7.2

    ### Windows

    For Windows, some drivers need to be installed to allow Network-Over-USB access to the BeagleBone black.
    You can find the instructions on the BeagleBone site's [getting started page](http://beagleboard.org/getting-started#step2).

    The connection process for Windows is a bit more involved.
    But when you're done, it should be just as simple to connect to the board.

    - First, follow [this guide](http://lanceme.blogspot.com/2013/06/windows-7-internet-sharing-for.html) for setting up Internet Sharing on your Windows computer
    - Next, install [PuTTY](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html) (or your preferred SSH client) to SSH into the BeagleBone Black
    - Finally, SSH into the BBB. It will have the same IP address (`192.168.7.2`)

    ### Credentials

    By default, the BeagleBone's login credentials are:

    - **user:** `root`
    - **pass:** none

    ## Creating a BeagleBone Black SD Card with Debian

    You may need to create a bootable SD card with the BBB Debian Linux distro.

    ### Finding the SD Card's Name

    #### OS X

    To find the name of the SD card on OS X, use the `diskutil` command:

        $ diskutil list
        /dev/disk0
          #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER
          0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.3 GB   disk0
          1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1
          2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            499.4 GB   disk0s2
          3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3
        /dev/disk1
          #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER
          0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *15.9 GB    disk1
          1:                 DOS_FAT_32 UNTITLED                15.9 GB    disk1s1

    In this case, the SD card's name is `/dev/disk1`.
    Before you proceed, be sure to eject the mounted volume:

        $ diskutil umount /dev/disk1s1

    #### Linux

    On most Linux distros, the `df -h` command should help you determine the name of your SD card.

    ### Downloading the Linux Image, Flashing the SD Card

    The image we're using is the official modified Debian distro provided by BeagleBoard, so we'll download it directly from them:
    [http://debian.beagleboard.org/images/bone-debian-7.5-2014-05-14-2gb.img.xz](http://debian.beagleboard.org/images/bone-debian-7.5-2014-05-14-2gb.img.xz).

    Once the image has downloaded, uncompress it with your favorite tool.

    The final step is to flash the image onto the SD card.
    You can do so by running this command (be sure to update the `of` section to point to the SD card who's name you learned earlier!):

        $ sudo dd bs=1M if=./bone-debian-7.5-2014-05-14-2gb.img of=/dev/sdb && sudo sync

    ## Configuring the BeagleBone Black

    After SSHing into the BeagleBone Black, save the following script into `~/profile`.
    Be sure to do this **on the BBB**.
    This will allow your BeagleBone Black to share your computer's internet connection.

        :::bash
        #!/bin/bash
        ROUTE=`route | grep 0.0.0.0 | wc -l`
        if [ $ROUTE -eq 0 ]
        then
            sudo -- sh -c 'echo "nameserver 8.8.8.8" >> /etc/resolv.conf'
            sudo /sbin/route add default gw 192.168.7.1
            ping www.google.com -q -c2 > /dev/null
            if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
                sudo ntpdate ntp.ubuntu.com
            fi
        fi

    After the script is saved, it will automatically run when the BeagleBone Black boots, so you only have to do this step once.

    ### Resizing the SD Card Partition

    At this point, we have a full Debian Linux OS set up, and can connect over SSH to the BBB.
    Now, we need to adjust the SD card's partitions, to give us space to install dependencies and do some work.

    First, login to the board over SSH, and run this series of commands:

        $ fdisk /dev/mmcblk0
        d
        2
        n
        p
        2

        w
        $ shutdown -r now

    After the board finishes restarting, log back in and resize the filesystem on the SD card before another restart:

        $ resize2fs /dev/mmcblk0p2
        $ shutdown -r now

    After this restart has completed, log back in, and check the partition has been correctly resized:

        $ df -h

    The `/dev/root` partition should take up the entire size of the SD card.
    With this done, we're now ready to start running Cylon directly on the BeagleBone Black.
