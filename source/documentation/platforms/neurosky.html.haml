    ## How To Use

    This example displays the Attention and Meditation data reading sent by the Mindwave Headset:

        :::javascript
        var Cylon = require('cylon');

        Cylon.robot({
          connection: {
            name: 'neurosky',
            adaptor: 'neurosky',
            port: '/dev/rfcomm0'
          },

          device: { name: 'headset', driver: 'neurosky' },

          work: function(my) {
            my.headset.on('attention', function(data) {
              console.log("attention:" + data);
            });

            my.headset.on('meditation', function(data) {
              console.log("meditation:" + data);
            });
          }
        }).start();

    ## How To Connect

    ### OSX

    In order to allow Cylon.js running on your Mac to access the Mindwave, go to "Bluetooth > Open Bluetooth Preferences > Sharing Setup" and make sure that "Bluetooth Sharing" is checked.

    ### Ubuntu

    Connecting to the Mindwave from Ubuntu or any other Linux-based OS can be done entirely from the command line using [Gort](http://gort.io) commands.
    Here are the steps:

    Find the address of the Mindwave, by using:

        $ gort scan bluetooth

    Pair to Mindwave using this command (substituting the actual address of your Mindwave):

        $ gort bluetooth pair <address>

    Connect to the Mindwave using this command (substituting the actual address of your Mindwave):

        $ gort bluetooth connect <address>

    ### Windows

    You should be able to pair your Mindwave using your normal system tray applet for Bluetooth, and then connect to the COM port that is bound to the device, such as `COM3`.
