      The Leap Motion is a user-interface device that tracks the user's hand motions, and translates them into events that can control robots and physical computing hardware.

%section#HowToInstall
  :markdown
    ## How To Install

        $ npm install cylon-leapmotion

    In order to use this module, you'll need to install the [Leap Motion software](https://www.leapmotion.com/setup) from their site.

%section#HowToUse
  :markdown
    ## How To Use

    This small program uses a Leap Motion to detect the user's hand position

        :::javascript
        var Cylon = require('cylon');

        Cylon.robot({
          connection: {
            name: 'leapmotion',
            adaptor: 'leapmotion'
          },

          device: {
            name: 'leapmotion',
            driver: 'leapmotion'
          },

          work: function(my) {
            my.leapmotion.on('hand', function(payload) {
              console.log(payload.toString());
            });
          }
        }).start();


%section#HowToConnect
  :markdown
    ## How To Connect

    ### OS X

    Our driver works out-of-the-box with the vanilla installation of the [Leap Motion software](https://www.leapmotion.com/setup).

    ### Ubuntu

    The Linux download of the Leap Motion software can be obtained from the [Leap Motion Dev Center](https://developer.leapmotion.com/downloads).

    To make sure everything's working:

    - Run the leapd daemon to open a websocket connection in port 6437.
    - Connect your computer and the Leap Motion controller
    - Connect to the device via Cylon.js

    ### Connecting To Another Machine

    By default, `cylon-leapmotion` attempts to connect to the LeapMotion websocket server running on localhost.
    You can, however, provide it with another IP in the `connection` object and it'll attempt to connect to that instead:

        :::javascript
        connection: {
          name: 'leapmotion',
          adaptor: 'leapmotion',
          host: '192.168.1.64'
        }
