        Cylon.robot({
          connection: { name: 'ardrone', adaptor: 'ardrone', port: '192.168.1.1' },
          device: { name: 'drone', driver: 'ardrone' },

          work: function(my) {
            my.drone.takeoff();

            after((10).seconds(), function() {
              my.drone.land();
            });

            after((15).seconds(), function() {
              my.drone.stop();
            });
          }
        }).start();

    ## How To Connect

    The ARDrone is a WiFi device, so there is no additional work to establish a connection to a single drone.
    However, in order to connect to multiple drones, you need to perform some configuration steps on each drone via SSH.
