      The Intel Galileo board is a microcontroller board based on the Intel Quark SoC X1000 application processor.
      It is intended to be compatible with shields designed for the Arduino Uno R3 or above.

    ## How To Install

    #### Setting up your Intel Galileo

    In order to use `cylon-intel-iot` on your Galileo, you need to install the Intel IoT linux boot image onto an sd card.
    You can download the latest image [here](https://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/iotdk/board-boot-image.html).

    For Windows hosts you can follow the instruction for flashing your sd card image [here](https://software.intel.com/en-us/node/530353).

    For Mac or Linux hosts, it's as easy as extracting the image from the downloaded archive and executing the command

        $ sudo dd if=/path/to/iot-devkit-latest-mmcblkp0.direct of=/dev/sdX bs=1M && sudo sync

    where `/dev/sdX` is the location of your sd card. For help determing the location of your sd card, consult the appropriate guide for your OS below. 

    ###### OS X Users

    To prepare your SD card for flashing on OS X, you need to find out it's drive name and eject the volume.

    To find the name, use the built-in `diskutil` utility:

        $ diskutil list
        /dev/disk0
          #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER
          0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.3 GB   disk0
          1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1
          2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            499.4 GB   disk0s2
          3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3
        /dev/disk1
          #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER
          0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *15.7 GB    disk1
          1:             Windows_FAT_32 NO NAME                 15.7 GB    disk1s1

    According to this, our SD card is found at `/dev/disk1`.

    Before you flash it with the above `dd` command, use `diskutil` to eject the existing volume (`disk1s1`):

        $ diskutil unmount /dev/disk1s1

    ###### Linux Users
    To prepare your SD card for flashing on Linux, you need to find the device location of your SD card. An easy way to determin the location is by filtering the `/dev/` directory for new storage devices. Before you plug in your SD card, execute the following `ls` command

        $ ls -l /dev/sd*
        brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8,  0 Sep 16 21:48 /dev/sda
        brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8,  1 Sep 16 21:48 /dev/sda1
        brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8,  2 Sep 16 21:48 /dev/sda2
        brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8,  5 Sep 16 21:48 /dev/sda5


    You can see that I only have one storage device `/dev/sda`. Now plug in your SD card and execute the `ls` command again

        $ ls -l /dev/sd*
        brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8,  0 Sep 16 21:48 /dev/sda
        brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8,  1 Sep 16 21:48 /dev/sda1
        brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8,  2 Sep 16 21:48 /dev/sda2
        brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8,  5 Sep 16 21:48 /dev/sda5
        brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8, 16 Sep 17 17:46 /dev/sdb
        brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8, 17 Sep 17 17:46 /dev/sdb1
        brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8, 18 Sep 17 17:46 /dev/sdb2


    You can see from this output that I now have a new storage device `/dev/sdb`. That is the location of my SD card, so in this instance the `/dev/sdX` in our `dd` command will be `/dev/sdb`.

    After the image has been flashed to your sd card, install the sd card into the Galileo, connect it to your local network and power it up!

    Now you're ready to install MRAA and Cylon.

    #### Install MRAA
    After you have flashed your Intel board and connected it to a network,
    you must now install the latest version of the
    [Intel MRAA library](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/mraa). In order to update MRAA
    you simply log into your Intel board, through ssh or the uart serial connection, and follow
    the steps [here](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/mraa#installing-on-your-board).

    #### Install Cylon

    Once you have flashed your Intel board with the latest firmware as well as updated MRAA,
    you will now install `cylon-intel-iot`. To do this you must be
    logged into the board, through ssh or the uart serial connection, and execute the
    following command

        $ npm install cylon-intel-iot

    Once `cylon-intel-iot` has been installed , you're ready to start programming!
