  # Hello

  For this exceedingly simple example, we're going to define a robot that has no
  devices, no connections, and just demonstrates the tools for performing work on
  an interval, and after a timeout.

  Let's start by importing Cylon:

      :::javascript
      var Cylon = require('cylon');

  Now we can define our robot:

      :::javascript
      Cylon.robot({

  For work, it's going to print a message to the console every second, and another
  message after ten seconds have elapsed.

      :::javascript
        work: function() {
          every((1).second(), function() {
            console.log("Hello, human!")
          });

          // This will happen only one time at the 5th second
          after((5).seconds(), function() {
            console.log("I've been at your command for 5 seconds now.")
          });
        }

  Simple as can be. Now that we're done, let's start the robot:

      :::javascript
      }).start();
