  # Button

  For this example, we're going to be connecting to a digispark, and when a button
  on one of its pins is pressed, a LED will be toggled.

  Before you start this example, make sure you've got the `cylon-digispark` module
  installed.

  We'll get started by importing the Cylon module:

      :::javascript
      var Cylon = require('cylon');

  Now that we have Cylon imported, let's start making our robot:

      :::javascript
      Cylon.robot({

  Our robot will have a connection to a digispark, and communicate with it via the
  littlewire protocol, we also include an `interval` param to specify how
  often we want to read the inputs, in this case every 0.1 seconds:

      :::javascript
        connection: { name: 'digispark', adaptor: 'digispark', interval: 0.1 },

  Our robot will have two devices, an LED and a button:

      :::javascript
        devices: [
          { name: 'led', driver: 'led', pin: 0 },
          { name: 'button', driver: 'button', pin: 5 }
        ],

  Our robot has very simple work, it will just toggle the LED whenever the button
  sends the 'push' event, we also log the press and release event, release is
  triggered when the button registers a Low voltage (0), press is
  triggered when the button registers a High voltage (1), and push is
  triggered when both events have been triggered (similar to a click event in the browser):

      :::javascript
        work: function(my) {
          my.button.on('press', function() {
            console.log('press:');
          });

          my.button.on('release', function() {
            console.log('release: ');
          });

          my.button.on('push', function() {
            console.log('push: ', my.button.isPressed());
            my.led.toggle();
          });
        }
  And with all that done, we can start our robot:
      }).start();
